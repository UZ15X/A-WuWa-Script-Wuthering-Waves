# A-WuWa-Script-Wuthering-Waves
An AutoHotKey script inspired by YAGS (Yet Another Genshin Script), but simpler, and for Wuthering Waves.

You **MUST HAVE** AutoHotKey installed to use this script.

You can configure the script by simply openning it in Notepad, Visual Studio Code, blah, blah, blah.

All the details are inside the script, but if you want a general gist of what's in it, I'll explain it briefly here.

# Movement: 

**"Auto_Super_Jump"** when true allows you to hold down the spacebar to perform a triple jump of sorts, but this requires that your equipped gadget is the grappler.

# Utility:

**"Auto_Use_Skill"** is self-explanatory, spamming "E" when held down.
**"Auto_Use_Echo"** is self-explanatory as well.
**"Auto_Use_Liberation"** ...
**"Auto_Swap_Characters"** is self-explanatory, but I'll explain it anyways. Hold down 1-3 to frame 1 swap to them or whatever. You get the point.

# Convenience: (kinda the same as utility)

**"RMB_Heavy_Attack"** rebinds your right click to a Heavy Attack, holding = longer press, duh.
**"Auto_Use_Gadget"** is self-explanatory, spamming "T" so you can keep using your gadget. Really useful with Sensor.
**"Auto_Fast_Travel"** is a bit weird so hear me out. When in the map, hover over any waypoint and press the "Forward" button on the side of your mouse if you have one. Very convenient, but doesn't work on personal waypoints, **yet**.
**"Auto_Attack"** is self-explanatory. Hold down the "Forward" button on the side of your mouse to effectively auto-click. Very useful if you're lazy and deal enough damage to shred things with just normals.

# Niche:

**"Chixia_Rapid_Fire"** Hold down the "Back" key on the side of your mouse to do the funny machine gun with Chixia's Heavy Attack. This is HEAVILY frame reliant and I have it optimized for my doodoo laptop, so if it doesn't work for you, scroll down in the script and find it, then change the "Sleep" times to be higher or lower depending on how beast your pc is.

I don't have anything else for Niche stuff, but if you have suggestions, please don't be afraid to DM me them at 1x5x0x7x3 on Discord.

# I will most likely be updating this occasionally as I'm more than addicted to the game and convenience is everything to me.

Also, there will be some bugs and issues here and there and while I normally would fix them, I'm too lazy to and to be honest, it's not like any of them will break the game or anything... I think.
